Percy Bysshe Shelley was the husband of Mary Shelley (writer of Frankenstein) and a contemporary and friend of Lord Byron. He is widely regarded as the finest poet of the Romantic period and possibly the greatest English poet of all time. A philosopher and atheist , expelled from Oxford for the publication of a pamphlet entitled &quot;The
Necessity of Atheism&quot;, Shelley led an itinerant life and died in 1822, drowned. </p>
<p align="left">&quot;Ozymandias&quot;
was written in 1818, in the same year that he
started on his most famous work, &quot;Prometheus
Unbound&quot;. At the time he was wandering in
Italy and Venice with Mary and Clare Claremont,
the cast-off lover of Byron, and the melancholy
that affected him during that time shows through
clearly in &quot;Ozymandias&quot;. </p>
<p align="left">The eponymous
&quot;Ozymandias&quot; is perhaps better known as
Rameses II, ruler of Egypt in the 13th century
BC. The poem has been interpreted in a number of
different ways, but all center on the irony in
Ozymandias' declaration that the
&quot;Mighty&quot; should &quot;look upon my
works, and despair&quot;.</p>
<p align="left">Shelley wrote
many other poems during this time, of which
&quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; remains the best known. Four
years later, he died, drowned at sea, with the
conviction that his work would never receive
popular acclaim. </p>
